## 1. Reddit r/SaaS — "Show r/SaaS" Style

**Title:** Show r/SaaS: I built a testimonial tool that collects reviews via WhatsApp and auto-redirects happy customers to Google Reviews

**Body:**

Hey r/SaaS 👋

I've been building TestimonioYa — a testimonial collection tool designed for small businesses, especially in Spanish-speaking markets.

**The problem:** Getting testimonials is painful. You send an email, nobody replies. Meanwhile, your Google Reviews page is empty and you're losing potential customers.

**What it does:**
- Collect testimonials via **WhatsApp, email, or a shareable link** (WhatsApp gets 3-5x higher response rates in LatAm)
- **Smart redirect:** Customers who leave positive feedback automatically get prompted to post it as a Google Review
- **Embeddable widget** to show testimonials on your site
- **NPS tracking** built in

**What makes it different:**
- Spanish-first (most tools are English-only and don't support WhatsApp well)
- The Google Reviews redirect is automatic — no manual follow-up needed
- Free tier, no credit card required

I'd love feedback from this community. What would you want to see in a tool like this?

## 2. Reddit r/smallbusiness

**Title:** Free tool to collect customer testimonials via WhatsApp/email and turn them into Google Reviews automatically

**Body:**

I run a small agency and the hardest part of growing was always getting clients to leave reviews. They'd say "yeah sure I'll do it" and then never did.

So I built a tool that makes it stupid simple:

1. **Send a request** via WhatsApp, email, or a link
2. **Customer writes a quick testimonial** (takes 30 seconds)
3. **If they're happy**, they automatically get redirected to your Google Reviews page to post it there too

It also gives you a widget to display testimonials on your website, and tracks your NPS score.

I made it free to start (no credit card), because I know small businesses don't want another $50/mo subscription just to ask for reviews.

Would love to hear if this would be useful for your business, and what features you'd want.

(It's Spanish-first since I built it for the LatAm market, but works in any language)

## 3. IndieHackers Community Post

**Title:** 🚀 Launched TestimonioYa — testimonials via WhatsApp with auto Google Reviews redirect

**Body:**

Hey IH! Excited to share what I've been working on.

**TestimonioYa** helps SMEs collect testimonials and turn them into Google Reviews — automatically.

### Why I built it
Most testimonial tools are built for the US/English market. In Latin America and Spain:
- Email open rates for review requests are terrible
- WhatsApp is how business gets done
- Google Reviews matter enormously for local businesses but nobody has a system to collect them

### How it works
- Send testimonial requests via WhatsApp, email, or link
- Happy customers get auto-redirected to leave a Google Review
- Embed testimonials on your website with a widget
- Track NPS over time

### Stack & business model
- Free tier (collect up to X testimonials/month)
- Paid plans for more volume + features
- Spanish-first, works globally

### What I'm looking for
- Feedback on the product
- Suggestions for growth channels (especially in the LatAm SaaS space)
- Anyone else building for Spanish-speaking markets?

Happy to answer any questions! 🙌

## Posting Tips

- **Reddit:** Don't post all at once. Space them 2-3 days apart. Engage genuinely in comments. Don't be salesy.
- **r/SaaS:** They appreciate technical details and honest "here's what I built" stories. Mention stack if relevant.
- **r/smallbusiness:** Focus on the **problem you solve**, not features. Speak their language (not "SaaS" jargon).
- **IndieHackers:** Community loves transparency. Share revenue numbers (even if $0), challenges, and ask for genuine feedback.
- **Best time to post on Reddit:** Weekday mornings US time (9-11 AM EST / Tuesday-Thursday)
