### Long Description (300–500 words)

**TestimonioYa — Testimonial Collection Made Simple for Small Businesses**

Getting customer reviews shouldn't require a developer, a big budget, or chasing people down by email. TestimonioYa is a testimonial management platform built specifically for small and medium-sized businesses — clinics, restaurants, local service providers, and agencies — that want to turn happy customers into visible social proof without the friction.

**Collect testimonials the way your customers already communicate.**

TestimonioYa meets your customers where they are: WhatsApp. Send a simple link or QR code and customers can respond with a text review, a voice note, or a short video — all in a familiar interface they already use every day. No apps to download. No forms to fill out. Just a quick, natural experience that drives real responses.

**From NPS to testimonial, automatically.**

TestimonioYa integrates NPS surveys natively. When a customer rates you 9 or 10, the platform automatically invites them to leave a testimonial — turning a satisfaction signal into a piece of content you can actually use. Promoters become advocates. High scores become published proof.

**Show off your reviews everywhere.**

Once you've collected testimonials, display them with a customizable Wall of Love widget you can embed on your website, landing page, or link-in-bio. The widget is fully brandable and works on any platform. You can also showcase individual quotes, video snippets, and star ratings to maximize conversion on your most important pages.

**Built for Spanish-speaking markets. Priced for real businesses.**

Most testimonial tools are built in English, priced in dollars, and designed for SaaS companies. TestimonioYa is natively Spanish-first, with pricing designed for SMBs in Spain and Latin America. It's a direct alternative to Senja and Testimonial.to — at a fraction of the cost, with features that matter to local businesses.

**Key capabilities:**
- ✅ Collect text, audio, and video testimonials via shareable link or QR code
- ✅ Built-in NPS → auto-testimonial request for high-scoring customers
- ✅ Embeddable Wall of Love widget (fully customizable)
- ✅ Google Review redirect integration to boost your local SEO
- ✅ Analytics dashboard to track performance across plans

Plans start free. Upgrade to Pro or Business for advanced analytics, automation, and higher volume.

If you're a clinic, restaurant, freelancer, or local business that wants more Google reviews and a professional way to display customer love — TestimonioYa is your tool.
